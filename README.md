# Single_Cycle_RISC_V
A structural 323 bit single cycle RISC V processor referring to the Computer Organization and Design,  SECOND EDITION, David A. Patterson Textbook.
In this, each modules are defined individually, all the components are part of the modules, the top module instatiates all the module blocks and has the interconnections.

The constraints file is also specified, the testbench is written to functionally verify the R type instructions. All the theoretical references will be in the repo as images, also the results folder contains the simulation and the synthesis representations.
